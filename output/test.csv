"5 For [REDACTED]. Firstly [REDACTED] gave me a good choice of tyres & prices to choose from. Ordering tyres & booking fitting was very easy. One of the reasons I chose [REDACTED], is that they offer Saturday fitting so it doesn't affect my working week. Got to fitters, which was only 15-20 minutes away, showed my order & they got started on it within 10-15 minutes. The staff at the garage were very friendly, listened to my instructions regarding which tyres needed changing & changed them quickly & efficiently.

The garage had problems on the day our tyres were due to be fitted.

Better if [REDACTED] mentions Tyre Thread Depth. I bought 2 Front Goodyear Eagle NCT5 A 205/45 R18 Y (86)) and 2 Rear Bridgestone Turanza T005 DriveGuard 225/40 R18 Y (92) fully fitted by one of the local garages on [REDACTED]. travelled only 2 miles in total from the time the tyres were fitted to the pre booked bmw service appointment who recorded the tyres depth as front 8mm and rear as 7mm. don't know if measurements taken by bmw are wrong.

"I have used you in the past and had excellent service, the past company I had the tyres fitted at were excellent, but no longer one of your options for fitting now. I chose your premium fitter in Basingstoke, Formula One Auto - and they were awful. Their customer service was non existent. I phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked, they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed, but I probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do. With this I sent my husband to have the tyres fitted, so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed. They took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres, way longer than it should have for 4 tyres. I phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge, which, because I know about cars I knew to be rubbish, he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me, which I would get in a week. I then discovered the next day when I took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi. After 10 days I phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived. I was promised a call back, which never came. A week later I chased again, again promised a call back and again did not hear from them. A few days later I called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back, but still did not call. a few days later I eventually got the cheque refund through. The tyres themselves are good, but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars. Thankfully although my husband doesn't I do, it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people. So for that reason whilst I may still recommend [REDACTED] for tyres I would be very, very, very careful about who fits mine in the future and advise anyone else to be too.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"My experience reflects more the fitting of tyres and not [REDACTED] . I had a fitting booked for 10.30am at fomula one tyres in bury st edmunds last friday, on arrival i was greeted well and informed they were running approx 20 mins behind,which wasnt a problem as i wasnt waiting but going to do some work a few hundred mtrs away. I left my contact details and was assured that it would be ready by lunch time . I heard nothing, so turned up at 2pm expecting new tyres on my car , however it hadnt been moved at all . At reception they apologised cos they just didnt have time to do my car, but they would have it done by 2.30 . I finally got my car with new tyres at 3.30 pm , some 5 hours after i left it.

The website was great. Had the tyres I wanted at a good price and the options for fitting were great. However. I opted for the. Mobile tyre fitter and I chose a fitting in the pm 3 days from when I ordered. Granted I did order on a weekend but I was told I could get my tyres. I then got a phone call 5 minutes before 12pm to tell me the tyres would not be fitted that day as they didn't get to the fitter in time.. I had arranged a half day off work to do this.

I have no fault with [REDACTED] ordering system or their availability of tyres however I do not feel that they properly inspect the standard of service being given by their garages.

"I should have learned my lesson the first time but I have now had a second poor experience with [REDACTED].

This I did (now one day before my holiday). My wife took the car to the garage at 0930 on the rescheduled date to be told the tyres still weren't available. After many conversations with customer service, identical tyres were sourced and fitted at 1630. No-one seems to know what happened to the original pair.

Very disappointed- really wanted to have a good experience having heard so much about this company and good reviews.Ordered tyres from a good selection with 2 day turnaround advertised by company.

"I have previously used [REDACTED] a few years ago with no problems so decided to use them again. Booking 4 new tyres for my Audi Q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘recommended’ garage, so far so good.So turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “the car wash is outside”, after pointing out I was there for 4 new tyres was told “oh sorry” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay. So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it?Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing, their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38 (approx as can’t remember exactly). After the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking, and the special price of £38 (I check my tyres regularly and had not seen any signs of uneven wear) so declined ......... call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking? Seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £38 out of people.So after approx 1hr 15 mins I left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok.Not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up. 4 days & less that 75 miles later I got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi.Moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the F/N/S wheel has a nut missing, the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the F/O/S wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers.I immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced BUT as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now I have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover. The managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should I settle for second bast. My car was in purse to condition when I went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy!!Overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and I would never use them again.

Bunch of money grabbers. I recently parked outside my local waste disposal tip (as a good citizen) only to get an immediate and fast puncture on my front nearside wheel on the sidewall.

"A bit of a mixed bag of goodbadgreat. A bit of a mixed bag in terms of overall experience I'm afraid, so lower rating than I anticipated. Finding and paying for the tires online, including the actual price for high grade Michelins, was all very good...things just fell apart after choosing the deliver and fit option to a local (big name) garage. Using the online booking too was a doddle but within 24hrs I had an email saying the time was no longer any good as the garage was fully booked. Then the customer service for alternative provision was basically picked for me from a few days/times I offered (a week later than my original slot mind you!). The worst part however was taking time of work to visit the garage only to be told 'they don't book tire fitting at their garage' and basically being told to wait in line for 45 mins behind the drive-in customers?! Bit pointless having a booking system and they fully blamed [REDACTED] for offering something online that well basically, wasn't offered in the real world. I have to say on the garage's part though they were excellent when I returned after about 40 mins and did the 2x tires very quickly and capably, so the eventual service was great. My tip then: ring the garage even if you book tires online with BC else you are wasting your time potentially!","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]"

"2 new tyres and a lot of waiting around. The purchase and arrangement of 2 new tyres for fitting at a convenient local garage was good. The price was a noticeable saving, and the pre-arranged fitting time meant I was expected at the garage reception. So far so good, with full marks to [REDACTED] at this point. My question from this point on is: how come it took the garage over an hour and a quarter to actually fit the tyres ? Ok, they were diligent enough to check all the wheels before they started, and reported unusual tyre wear on the fronts - for which we agreed to check the alignment. But the alignment check and adjustment was only carried out after the aforementioned 1.25hrs, and trhe end result was a 2 hour visit. For 2 tyres. On a prearranged 1/2 hr slot. With 5 days notice. This to me is unacceptable - some people also have jobs to go to, and I wasn't anticipating this chunk of time taken out of my working day.If Red Bull's F1 team can do it in 1.88 seconds with half a lap's notice , how come a major national chain can be as slovenly as this ?

"[REDACTED] used to offer to best price in the market and an accurate fitting time but not anymore!The prices have gone up considerably and the fitting times much more loosely offered.Also, to top it all, the fitter changed a perfectly good tyre with around 5mm of tread, ( it was partially my partners mistake as she mixed up near side and offside, but you would think the fitter would question it!!)The fitters were apparently pretty unfriendly and she didn’t want to go back to question their mistake.All in all I don’t think I will use [REDACTED] in the future, over the years I must have ordered 20 tyres for myself, friends and family so I was pretty loyal.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"Where do I start... I have used [REDACTED] for years and never had an issue, however that isn’t the case now. I initially booked a mobile fitting service, who damaged my locking wheel but and so couldn’t proceed, had to then travel to a garage to have fitted, which seemed fine, until I noticed one of the tyres was the wrong size. Called and emailed numerous times, and was hit and miss as to whether I got any response. Ended up using PayPal’s escalation process, who refunded me one of the tyres as they also never received a response. Rebooked from scratch with a weeks notice to get fitted, only to now be told at 17:30 day before that there had been a supply issue, and therefore need to rearrange for a weeks time.

Tyres good price and fitting good too. Down side...

Bought the tyres online 1 week before appointment to have them fitted. Turned up at my local ATS only to discover [REDACTED] had only delivered 1 of my 2 tyres.

"I looked at the [REDACTED] website and it seemed ideal - very competitive price , very local fitting and appeared that I could get my tyre replaced very quickly.I'd got a puncture on Saturday night so on Monday i tried to ge ta new tyre - the [REDACTED] website said first available date wednesday -i thought this was reasonable as i have had difficulty sourcing tyres before - I picked a very local garage and it came up with virtually every time slot available - I picked one and received an email with booking reference etc.... I assumed this meant it was booked.The next day I received an email and text saying to contact [REDACTED] urgently - which I did - I was told I couldn't have the appointment I had booked and on asking for an alternative appointment that day I was told there were NONE available - they were fully booked. I asked why I had received an email and was told that isn't a confirmation!I was then told I could have an appointment on Thurs at ANY time - I opted for 11:00am although I could have done any time... I was contacted about 10mins later to be told there were NO appointments for the WHOLE of thursday... why offer me any time iwanted if i wasn't able to get any appointment ??By this time I just wished I'd never paid for the tyre and had tried elsewhere - I was then told I could have any time Friday!! I said I was working on Friday and wouldn't be able to ge tto the garage until 15:30....they shut at 16.00! ...but I was told I could have that time.I arrived at the garage early and they said they could do my tyre now...but when they went to look they said they didn't think the tyre had come as there was nothing in my name...As I was about to explode they said they had a tyre not in my name that they could fit now.After explaining my frustrating experience to the guy in the garage he said if i'd called them directly on Monday - they could have done it that afternoon!!!!... although they probably couldn't compete with the price - he looked for me and it would have cost £6 more!!! I probably would have paid £40 more!! NOT because i wanted to but for the convenience and lack of stress i had to endure dealing with [REDACTED].If in the beginning I'd been told i couldn't have it done until Friday i would have been frustrated but it would have been my choice wether i continued with the purchase or went elsewhere - but to be mucked about and having to reschedule appointments etc....i DEFINITELY will NOT be using them again or be recommending them to anyone else","[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"The whole process went like clockwork. The only slight concern I have, is that prior to the new tyres having been fitted, there were no problems with my steering wheel. Having had the new tyres, when I reached 70mph on the motorway, I had steering wheel vibration. I assumed that there needed to be an adjustment with the balancing. I rang up and arranged to take the car back with no problems. ""Tommy""went to check the off side front wheel first, and then changed his mind and did the near side. It was slightly out. He then did the off side and immediately he put the wheel on the balancing machine, he said the wheel was buckled and there was nothing he could do. He showed me the buckle and asked if I had hit a pot hole. (I had not) It was almost as if he knew what he was going to find. Somehow, it did not add up and I am now having to get the wheel straightened or at worst, get a new one.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Tyres delivered quickly and excellent time slot for me. Tyres delivered quickly and excellent time for fitting provided for me. The actual fitting took a bit longer than expected. Apparently this was due to one of the new tyres not inflating on the rim.

"I normally have no problems with [REDACTED] BUT. I normally have no problems with [REDACTED] and they would normally get 5 stars. Last month however changed that.

The ones I ordered showed B, C, 71. Only a slight difference I know, but that swayed me to buy those particular tyres.

"Having a BMW with staggered wheels it's very difficult to find x 2 pairs of the same tyre in the same place. I was thinking of removing the run flat tyres from our F31 330d for many reasons but this was a job for the future...... until on my way home from work 2 days before we went on Holiday to France I picked up a puncture. The annoying thing was, the tyres x 4 had loads of life left on them so I had to bite the bullet and change all 4. [REDACTED] were amazing, they were quick and professional even to the point where they had realised that I had ordered non runflat tyres and sent me a warning Email in case I was not aware of my error. The tyres were delivered the next day to the garage of my choice in Lincoln. F1 Autocentres even managed to get the car in a day early so as we could be on our way to Holiday on time. Overall I would highly recommend this service to anyone. Not only for the swift professional dispatch of the order but the amount of money we saved compared to using other well known suppliers.

"Garage Was Great [REDACTED] Wasnt. Overall, I'm really chuffed with the product (4 x Michelin Pilot Sport 4's) and the job the premier partner (Strathclyde Autotune) carried out.However, the customer service experience at [REDACTED] left a lot to be desired after it came to light I was consistently given incorrect information by email, and later on the phone.To cut a long story short, [REDACTED] appear to book jobs and services for you on their own system without consulting the garage you choose and their schedule for that given day.I booked a tyre fitting for 4 new tyres and selected some additional services.I was never given an appointment time. Similarly, the services I selected were split across a Friday and a Monday.Not the end of the world..but the tyre fitting was scheduled for Friday and TPMS Sensor Valve Replacement was scheduled for the Monday.For me it made more sense to fit the sensors on Friday whilst the wheels are already coming off to fit the tyres?Anyway, I phoned to challenge this aspect and to double check why I wasn't given an appointment time.I was told adamantly that the garage operated on a first-come-first-serve basis and that they couldn't provide the additional services I asked for.I struggled to see the value in this system over scheduled appointments; but I went along with it as I had already paid for the tyres.Cut To: Me the next day getting up super early to be the first person in this first-come-first-serve queue.After arriving at the garage before the staff, I thought it was odd that no other people were rushing to get there first?Turns out that the garage has an appointment book, and [REDACTED] tell you it's first-come-first-serve, and split your services across a weekend for no other reason than to cause total inconvenience?The garage was great though!.. I've had the car back there since and will continue to use them.","[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

They told me the tyre had arrived at the garage and I needed to call the garage. I called the garage who then informed me that the tyre was not there. I then had to get back in touch with [REDACTED] for them to speak again to the garage. I was then informed that the tyre was there and my appointment was rescheduled to take my car in any time after 12pm. I arrived for the garage to tell me my appointment was at 1pm and needed to go away and come back. I have not been impressed with [REDACTED].,"[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"The garage we chose from your listing gave us a time. We arrived there but no-one was on the reception desk & nobody came until finally I went out into the bay to request assistance but it was still a long time before anybody came. Finally after being attended to we were told we'd have to wait another 45mins before the tyres could be put on this being despite the fact that we had booked in & arrived on time. When we finally did get the car back, which took longer than (the added) 45 minutes I'd missed important work hours & we almost missed picking up our small daughter from school on time. A week later I drove the car on the motorway & there's an awful wobble when getting close to motorway speeds. This was not there prior to taking the vehicle in. A very unsatisfactory experience from beginning to end. We shall shop for our vehicles elsewhere in future.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Cut a long story short, the garage told [REDACTED] they were unable to fit me in at 9am on Sat 23 March, but they could do 10am on Fri 22 March. That’s fine, however [REDACTED] neglected to inform me of this and I had to rearrange my entire weekend plans. The garage was able to fit me in on the Sunday morning, however myself, my daughter and my parents had to change our entire weekend plans to accommodate this. Also, my wife bought a tyre through the [REDACTED] website, using the correct reference details and [REDACTED] sent the wrong tyre to the garage. My wife has now had to wait a week for [REDACTED] to issue the correct tyre and the garage to have the availability to fit her in.I would not use or recommend [REDACTED] to anyone. The only reason I gave them one star was because the website would not allow me to complete this review without selecting at least one star.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Excellent price service. Recently bought 2 new tires from [REDACTED].com & was very pleased with the price which was much cheaper than I could find any where else. Gave several places for the fitting service near me which was done as soon as we arrived & back on the road within 25 minutes. Only issue we had was that the tire pressure warning light was on after fitting. They said it will go out when I start driving but it did not. Stopped at a petrol station & found the new tires were well below the correct pressure. Perhaps if they are not sure of the pressure then they should ask the customer. Not a big issue & easily resolved. Highly recommend & wont hesitate to look there when I need anymore tires.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]"

Delivery failures which were avoidable. We had to wait over an hour past fitment time and when they’d remove the front tyres they discovered one of the new ones had been damaged in transit so they old tyre had to go back on followed by another 2 day wait.
