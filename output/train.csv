Tyre not at garage when you said it would be even though you had sent me multiple messages about my fitting.

Bad experience this time. Garage didnt balance wheels properly. Took car back and they rebalanced- car was even worse. I drove 500 miles to Scotland with a wobbly steering wheel.

"I ordered the tyres online at the weekend and after choosing the tyres and the fitter I was given the option of time on the following Thursday.I could either have the morning or the afternoon on a first-come first-served basis.

"What can I say... I'm a typical girl! The only thing that usually concerns me about my car is the 'pretty' colour!... üòè... so, when it comes to getting new tyres for my Hyundai Tucson, I was clueless! Anyway, I popped onto [REDACTED] website and I can honestly say it was one of the best experiences ever!!! I literally put in my number plate and up popped a bunch of tyres at various prices from budget to high end! The price included delivery to a local garage, VAT and fitting and took me about 5 minutes from start to finish. I paid online and then got two emails, one confirming payment and the other to arrange fitting. I did this online too from the link in the email which showed me several garages in my area... I went to my appointment 3 days later at 9am (my choice, they could have done it even sooner!) and they were waiting for me with my two new tyres!

"Reasonable priced tires (discounted via Direct Line Insurance). Had a few issues making payment on the website but resolved after speaking to my bank ... website was not recognised by TSB and they blocked purchase!

Day before I got an email around 5pm to advise they can‚Äôt fulfil my order and they‚Äôve cancelled my booking with garage. Attempted to move it to another date that I couldn‚Äôt attend due to work. Told them to cancel and requested a refund. Next day (original day of garage booking), I received a text / email advising tires have now arrived at garage and that I can call along to get them fitted. Arrived at garage who informed me tires had been there for three days! Very very poor customer service, messed me about and made me late for work. If it wasn‚Äôt for the discount provided via Direct Line I wouldn‚Äôt have used this company and doubt I will in future.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED]. The process of choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me. The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms. The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know. Prices are slightly cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.

"2x Bridgestone Potenza S001 285/30R19 Merc OnlyPROS:1) (easily) Best fitted price available anywhere2) Fitted at a local trader I know3) Customer Service was excellent in fixing a problem with the orderCONS:NONE!I bought 2 pretty expensive tyres for my Merc CLS. I‚Äôd had Bridgestones on my summer wheels for over 40,000 miles on the rears. I‚Äôve been running Winter Wheels and tyres and when I had to get my summer wheels back on and the rears replaced, I tried [REDACTED] (BC). Having bought tyres online for the last 3 sets of tyres, I found BC to be the cheapest available for what is quite an unusual size. Add to this there was a 10% off flash sale that day and the price was considerably cheaper than TyreLeader. The wheels and tyres were fitted by a local tyre dealer I know. Unfortunately when I got home, I realised that one of the tyres was not a Mercedes Only(MO) tyre. The difference between the standard tyre and the MO is that the MO tyre has a significant 2cm flange that protects my lovely AMG 19in rims. I often say that you only know what a company is like until there is a problem. The resolution of the problem is the mark of how good the company is. BC went above and beyond:I contacted BC and they were fantastic. As I work in London, and I‚Äôm busy at the moment, it took me a little while to get round to taking photos for BC‚Äôs reference. However, despite having travelled over 700 miles since fitting, BC have arranged for the tyre to be replaced with the correct one. Additionally, BC gave me a generous goodwill gesture as recognition of my inconvenience. I will not only buy all my future tyres from them, but I will also highly recommend them to my family and friends. If all companies treated their customers with the efficiency, courtesy and genuine desire to provide a good service, as BC do, the world would be a better place! Well done [REDACTED] and thank you.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"Excellent prices and service.I have used [REDACTED] several times over recent years. I require quality high performance tyres and they have ALWAYS been the lowest price compared to all other suppliers online. On the most recent purchase I had an issue ( not BC‚Äôs fault, but my own error ) and they contacted me as I requested and they resolved the issue I had straight away - how customer service should be. I have also never had any problems when I have attended one of their many fitting partners - also have the option for the fitters to come to the customer for a reasonable ¬£6 extra charge - I‚Äôve never used that option so can‚Äôt comment on its quality. Out of curiosity I asked the recent fitting centre I had used how much the tyre supply and fitmeant would cost if I bought the tyre from them.

"So it was my first time ordering from you - the website, great, easy to use. Purchasing the tyres and selecting the extra for the tracking - great, no issues at all. I bought on the 27th and it was confirmed on the 29th for fitting on the 31st. I was then contacted on the 30th to advise there was a delay in delivering the tyres so they changed the fitting day to Friday 2nd August (Today) Upon arriving, the order (I looked on their screen) was for 1 tyre to be fit, not 2. They called through to try and sort this, which took a few attempts but got resolved. I also noticed that on their screen they had the tyres on the 30th?

"I've used [REDACTED] several times over the last 10 or so years. My car, my wife's car and our motorhome. On every occasion I saved money and the choosing and fitting process was simple.

"Great prices and buying experience but queries take a while to be resolved. On the whole my experience with them is great.

Dealing with [REDACTED] was easy and cheaper than I found locally. Even though I mucked it up initially and had to 'phone them to change to the correct tyres they were helpful and friendly.

"Tyre fitter at Lakeside was excellent, and happy with the tyres and the price. I had to wait for the tyres to be delivered which was ok. However, that‚Äôs when it became disappointing. I receive notification at 8:50 am one morning that I should go to have my tires fitted at 9:45 that same morning. That was simply not enough notice!The fitters were reluctant to fit the tires without authorisation from head office‚Ä¶ So would I contact head office. I tried to phone, to receive a message saying that they were so busy, unless it was an emergency, please phone back later. I then decided to send an email, to which I‚Äôve still had no response. So I phoned again, only to receive exactly the same message, but they were so busy, but couldn‚Äôt talk to me, and could iPhone back.So I had paid for my tires, they had been delivered, but I was struggling to get them fitted.

Had fantastic service in the past, but this time was not so good.I ordered 2 x Michelin Pilot SuperSport tyres in 255/35/19 profile to be fitted several days later at 9am at a local ATS branch.Dropped the car with them on the basis that it would be ready by lunchtime, so I arranged to collect the car then (as I needed to use it in the afternoon).At 11am I received a call from ATS to say they‚Äôd removed my old tyres and realised that the new ones hadn‚Äôt arrived from [REDACTED].com. They offered to order them in but I‚Äôd not be able to collect the car until the end of the day as the tyres wouldn‚Äôt arrive until 4pm.This was nothing worse than an inconvenience, but given that the price paid was identical to ATS fitted price (but they had a deal on when you bought two tyres) and in actual fact ¬£20 more expensive that Kwik Fit, I regretted automatically going to [REDACTED] based on previous experience.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

No details were given not any confirmation as to when pm is other than after 12. I waited in all afternoon then the garage called me around 3pm and stated [REDACTED] had delivered 2 different tyres and therefore could no longer fit them. I called [REDACTED] and was on hold for 10mins before someone eventually admired the mistake. They apologised and said I would get some compensation and would arrive in 3/5 days.

"Surprisingly Poor Service. I've used [REDACTED] many times in the past and have been really pleased with the value for money and customer service. It therefore came as a shock to experience really poor service on this occassion.Everything seemed fine at first, my order went though and I was looking forward to having two reasonably priced tyres fitted at a convenient time on a Saturday morning. Later that day I received an email to say the garage could not fit my tyres on the Saturday, that was slightly annoying but OK, I replied to the email to say their suggested fitting day of the following Tuesday would be fine.The next day I receive an email saying they can't deliver my tyres to the garage for the following Tuesday, bearing in mind that it's only Friday at this point and if so why was it even suggested to me as a possible fitting date. Their new suggested day wasn't convenient and I was beginning to feel messed around so I replied saying it was becoming slightly ridiculous now and that I'd have to make alternative arrangements so please cancel the order. Three days later and I still had not received a response or order cancellation from them. I sent an email suggesting rather sternly that they get their act together and cancel/refund my order. It was another day, nearly a wek after the initial order that it was finally cancelled. There was no apology, no explanation, nothing in their email.I really am confused as to why [REDACTED] would think I should use them again or reccommend them to friends or family.

No notice of being unable to fit tyres offered fitting five days later. Ordered a Tyre for my daughters car as existing tyre irreparable. As no spare until replaced could not drive car. Ordered on Weds for fitting Saturday morning. Received an e mail at 7.51 am about feedback and another at 7.52 stating that the tyre could not be fitted on Saturday and the earliest date for fitting would be five days later on Weds. During this time my daughter would have no driveable car. She needed the car on Saturday. This meant I had little chance of finding a local tyre fitter to fit a tyre on the busiest morning of the week and certainly not at a competitive price.

"4 New Michelin Tyres on 20 Rims.

"Purchased two new Michelin run-flat tyres and selected a fitting date with my local garage all through the [REDACTED] website securing a great deal with a 10% flash sale discount. However, a day before the fitting I was told the tyres were not available and offered a pair of Pirelli‚Äôs for the same price. I would have liked the option of my preferred Michelin not available at time of the purchase or not available on the website. As I wanted the Michelin I declined and opted for a refund. This did not materialise within the 3-5 days. A quick email after that period fixed that problem and money back in account 3 days later. It happens. Definitely will use [REDACTED] again as their a great company. As for the fitter they were fine but took ages to fit the two tyres. I dropped car off at 8am and earliest I could get it was 2pm.

It was an issue with the valves and they fitted new tyres. [REDACTED] followed up to make sure everything had been sorted. Whilst I obviously would have prefered that the tyres had not been defective, I think the best measure of a company is how they handle it when something goes wrong.

Very happy with the service given to me. I arrived 10 minutes early and the lads jumped straight on my car while I waited. I am very protective over my car as she‚Äôs my pride and joy so I did watch them from start to finish. It‚Äôs nice to see them do it by the book without using a nut gun. Thankyou. I went to a different garage later that day as I needed the fronts urgently and couldn‚Äôt wait for your delivery time and they used a nut gun and didn‚Äôt removed the old wheel weights before balancing.

"I ordered a Dunlop SP Sport Maxx 255/45 R17 W (98) tyre for my Mercedes on the [REDACTED] website. As usual, I took a screen-shot of the 'Order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records. Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [REDACTED] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run-flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx. I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run-flat version. Even after I emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre. (Sub-text; another stupid customer!)I have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [REDACTED] may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'Order Confirmation' screen. After you enter a tyre number (AND the vehicle that the tyre is for!), the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size. The large, headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre (in my case 'Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT' followed by some generic (and therefore worthless) 4 and 5-star reviews. Between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos. All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon, presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane. Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari etc as well as 'Run Flat', and MO. There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Your element was excellent however your approved garage was far from it. I turned up 5 minutes before the agreed fitting time at HiQ Neathand they didnt seem bothered. After 10 minutes of waiting I asked what was happening and they said they werent too sure as it was nothing to do with them because I bought through [REDACTED]. They then decided it was time to take my vehicle into the workshop and eventually after 50 minutes the job was done. I do not excpect to wait 50 minutes for 2 tyres to be replaced.

"Great prices appalling organisational skills Would not use again. I needed tires fitted at the weekend as mine were severely worn according to my MOT and I had a number of journeys to make with some pretty appalling weather forecaster. A friend suggested I check out [REDACTED], the prices looked great and a good range of local garages (5 within 6 miles or so of me) so I went ahead and placed an order. The following day (Friday) I received an email from them saying they couldn't book me in on the Saturday at my chosen garage and the next available slot was the following Monday. I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded. No apology for the inconvenience or anything like that and then a follow up email asking me to review my conversation with someone I had never spoken with. I presume all the good reviews on here are people who haven't had an issue and everything has gone smoothly and all power to them, just beware that if something does go wrong with your order it seems you're stuffed trying to sort it out.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"All in all a great service. There was a little confusion on the expected delivery times of my new tyre to my local garage. This confusion was caused by mixed messages in the emails from [REDACTED]. One email said that the tyre was going to be late and I needed to rearrange which I did. Then another email said the tyre would now not be late and the original time slot was still available. But I was not aware of this update until it was too late to confirm. A third email confirmed a new time slot -for a date that was yesterday! Obviously I challenged this and they then corrected the mistake. In the end the tyre change went well, no hiccups in the garage. Would still use [REDACTED] again, just wish for more clarity and less confusion in future.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

[REDACTED] tyres saved me a lot of money but the service from Savoy tyres in willerby was less than satisfactory. I bought 2 tyres. 1 for the front left and 1 for the rear left but I wanted the new tyre to be fitted to the original wheel and then fitted. They wanted to charge an extra ¬£10 for doing that. They finally agreed not to charge me extra so I asked about tracking but they would only do that if i replaced both front tyres and they would charge extra for that on top of the normal price for tracking. I declined that and went else where for the tracking.

"Why not try to experience great money saving adventure for choosing right tyres with reasonable comparison with other top branded products.

"Not great. I think I would have got a better service else where. I requested the garage to maintain my original Bmw metal dust caps but they didn‚Äôt, replying: they‚Äôre not original mate, so I didn‚Äôt bother. Regardless of whether he thought they were (which they are!!) I don‚Äôt see the problem? They also said one of the wheels was corroded so required a bead seal. I‚Äôm not entirely sure it was but I got charged an extra ¬£24 for the privilege. They also damaged the wheel while putting on one of the new tyres. I think they disturbed an old kerb repair but again their mentality was one of complete denial. I won‚Äôt be using this service again. I can see why people just got to main dealers.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The ordering process is very easy to use and convenient. It allows you to book a fitting at the nearest garage. I placed the order on Wednesday for a Friday fitting. On Thursday afternoon I received an email stating there was an issue delivering my tyre to the garage and that my fitting was being rebooked to Tuesday. I had to phone [REDACTED] as I had already made arrangements and taken time off work to have the fitting on Friday. I am reliant on my vehicle for transport to work and of course this meant that I would be without a vehicle for another 4 days!. [REDACTED] were unable to keep the Friday booking and I was offered a small compensation by the rep on the phone. I kept the booking on Tuesday as the tyre which I ordered was only available through [REDACTED]. Come Tuesday there was no further problems the garage I chose was spot on. I awaited the compensation to be refunded back. Another week goes by and there was no sign of any compensation or any communication. So I rang [REDACTED] who told me there was no note on their system regarding me being given any compo.This was sorted the following day and I did receive the amount promised.Overall I would say this was a rough ride ordering from [REDACTED]. It's a shame they are failing at such little things and leave you stranded. The whole point of ordering a tyre from the internet is so that it is convenient and reliable. Unfortunately I can't say this about [REDACTED] at this point in time.If you are pushed for time I would rather recommend going to a local garage and pay the premium but get your tyres done the same day.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
Good service by [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] provided a good service at a good price.

Purchasing tyres was easy. Getting them fitted was a complete nightmare.- 14/08. Arrived at 7.45am for an 8am fitting. I left the garage at 11am. I complained at the timeabout the time it took took replace the 4 tyres. - 15/08. Started vehicle at 7.30am to drive to work. Tyre pressure warning light came on so checked tyres. Rear driver side tyre low as tyre was leaking air. Also noticed the tyre fitters had damaged wheels. Had to drive to the fitters to sort out air leak and complained about fresh damage to wheels. Took abou half for them to sort wheels and decided I would complain in writing rather than confront the fitters as at the time I was and am fuming. - 15/08. MOT booked in with BMW. Car passed MOT. However I was advised that the front brake pad warning wire was hanging. Had to book car in again on the 18/08 to be rectified.19/08. BMW checked the front brake pad warning wire. Brake Pads and discs replaced by BMW in March and was advised by BMW that the front brake pad warning compartment was cracked and the wire left hanging when the tyres were changed.Im not one to complain.

After being given a fitting date when the order was placed I then received an email saying that it would be pushed out by an additional 2 days due to unforeseen problems. This email was sent after closing hours so I couldn't make contact to try and resolve the issue sooner. I then had to call back then next day numerous times to find a solution. It turned out that it was simply because the arrival of the tyres hadn't been confirmed with the fitting centre. Turns out tyres were there after all and they could be fitted on the requested day but by this point not until lunchtime and I'd had to take time off work to get this sorted and done.,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"AVOID [REDACTED] their mobile fitting service. On Sunday (04/08/2019) we had paid and booked for a tyre to be fitted on Wednesday (07/08/2019)We had been given the option of an AM or PM booking (no time specific) We chose an AM booking. Tuesday evening came an email at 17.31 saying there had been a delay on the tyre and they needed to reschedule to Friday. This was no good to us as we needed it fitting Thursday at the latest due to a long drive. The option to call them straight away wasn't there, as their offices close at 17.30 coincidentally! Called them first thing Wednesday AM, my partner stressed that a fitting for Friday was not possible and Thursday would be the latest we could have it done.After speaking to the woman on the phone for 10 minutes and a few back and forth phone calls later, she agreed to have a fitter come out and fit the tyre on Thursday (AM) email confirmation received stating AM delivey/fitting.Thursday 11:30am and the fitter still hadn't arrived. My partner rang [REDACTED] and she said that an AM booking is anywhere between 9AM &1PM. 1:30PM and the fitter still hadn't arrived. She waited an hour and rang [REDACTED] back, after a few back and forth phonecalls they said the fitter was stuck in traffic, and possibly wouldn't be able to get to her till after 5PM.My partner suggested they came to our house after 5pm as this really needed doing and we had aleady been let down 3 times, [REDACTED] gave us the number of the fitter so we could contact him.5:15PM and still no sign of the fitter at home. My partner decides to ring the number that was provided.The fitter said that [REDACTED] should of told us that he wouldn't be able to get to us till tomorrow morning now.My partner said it needed to be done today. He said he would get in touch with a fitter and get back to us. 7:12 and we still haven't heard anything from anyone. My partner tried calling [REDACTED], but their offices are now shut.

I ordered my tyres they got delivered and also got fitted - however when I arrived for my appointment I got asked who booked the car in by the manager I believe he told me they had advised [REDACTED] to cancel appointments as they were short staffed and double booked.

At that point I left the garage as I needed to be at my hospital appointment. I then had to make arrangements to get to the hospital and also to get back to collect my car I arrived back and my car was done.

It took him less than 30 minutes to remove, re-fit, and balance 2 rear tyres. Very quick, easy and hassle free. Best ¬£6 i've ever spent.The tyres are brilliant so far, they were the cheapest option available in my size, and they are much better than my old Pirelli tyres.

"Booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as I wanted to keep the tyres already on the car. The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland. We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM. At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening? I spoke to [REDACTED] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday. I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn't trust them but they did. The following Saturday arrived and once again, no one showed. I called [REDACTED] who called the tyre fitters. Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment. The problem is that there is a big issue with the tyre fitters they use/in general and I would not recommend whatsoever, having your tyres mobile fitted in the Leeds/Bradford area as this is the only mobile tyre fitter [REDACTED] use.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"My tyres were out of stock for a few days so I couldn't complete my order but once back in everything was easy to arrange and get sorted.

"Pretty poor experience overall. [REDACTED] delayed my tyres by a few days beyond when it was agreed they would be fitted. When tyres were eventually fitted they were the wrong size and having driven my car, I damaged my two alloys. Nothing was offered by way of compensation other than the meaningless ‚Äòsincere apologies‚Äô. They did offer to fix my alloys and have them them re cut (which I have to organise and submit quotes etc) but nothing else. When the correct tyres were due to be fitted they again delayed the order and I‚Äôm hoping (but not holding my breath) that the correct tyres will be fitted tomorrow. I‚Äôve had my car sitting in my drive for several days waiting for [REDACTED] to rectify their error. I hoped putting a customer out by a week might concern them but it really doesn‚Äôt. In summary they put themselves forward as a friendly, quirky service with their customer servers and personal bios stating they live in Edinburgh and enjoy watching TV, spending time with family and hillwalking. While they enjoy things like this, it‚Äôs pretty clear they don‚Äôt give one care about providing a good service and carrying out a simple task such as delivering and fitting a tyres. I will never be using them again. If you live in the Highlands just go anywhere else, regardless of the cost. These guys are just absolutely useless.","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"First time order from [REDACTED].Tyres ordered fine and I was offered an or pm. Chose pm thinking it meant I could go anytime in the afternoon to get tyres replaced. Day later got email with time I was expected at fitters. Emailed back to say that I couldn‚Äôt do the time given due to work and that 4:30 to 6pm would be best if possible. Email came back later the same day with a 5pm time slot. Got to tyre fitters and they said they could not get wheels off to change tyres due to stripped locking wheel but key. Said they couldn‚Äôt do it as they closed at 6pm and it was now 5:45pm. They requested I get lockers removed and then come back. I asked about making another appointment and they told me it would be an issue holding the tyres or getting them fitted when I got back. The next day I was able to get one of the nuts off by myself but was unable to get other off. Went to another garage over weekend who got it off. Took car back to tyre fitters and they fitted new tryres without a problem. So moral of this story, check you locking wheel nuts before taking you car in to get the tyres replaced.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience. Firstly the purchasing experience was not great. I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of ¬£65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"I've bought several motorcycle tyres from [REDACTED] and always thought the service and value were good.However the front of the pair of motorcycle tyre I bought on the last occasion was defective. The tyres were fitted and balanced by my very experienced tyre man but I discovered that at speeds over 45mph the handlebars oscillated and this worsened until by 60mph it was unbearable. Tyre man removed, refitted and rebalanced the tyre but problem remained. Tyre man spotted that the tyre did not run true, the carcass was distorted. Tyre man fitted an old tyre and all was well, thus proving the new tyre was faulty. This was reported to [REDACTED] and they replaced the tyre and took the defective tyre for analysis. This at no cost to myself.That is brilliant and gives me great confidence to continue using [REDACTED]. First class customer service!

"I went through [REDACTED] to get 2 new front tyres. I thought it was hassle free and any easy way to book to get my tyres done.

They had to ring around 2 other local garages before they could find me another garage that would fit me in 2 days later than my original appointment. Although this may not have been [REDACTED] fault this was very stressful for me as my car had already failed the MOT hence why I booked my car in ASAP!

"This is not a review of [REDACTED].com as such but my experience of the garage booked through them (A&S MOT Ltd).A terrible experience meaning I will never use A&S MOT Ltd again. Details of the issues are below.- Arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4-wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside- Took time off work and waited at garage. Work done and was given paperwork. Wheels dirty - but as expected- Left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- Got to work and checked values on paperwork. Rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- Left work early and returned to garage. Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- Rang Audi to ask about part required etc. and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage, both front AND rear- Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm. They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc.- Took more time off work to return to A&S as agreed. Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- When finished told ""all done"" - given no paperwork. Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there. Rear STILL not adjusted- Asked for an explanation. Wasn't given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN- I then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me. I checked the dash cam. Found out it had been moved to point at the sky. Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON‚ÄôT use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"My first experience was great really straight forward fitter was really friendly, I did not hesitate to go back for my next purchase, unfortunately the fitter I had used before was busy so I chose another local one all seemed great.Then I get an email informing me my chosen fitter is unable to accomodate my tyre size, fine but if so they really should remove them as an option when you buy that size tyre.I was offered another fitter further away probably the only one available that day but I did not wish to drive too far with a tyre that could deflate at any time, I tried to decline the suggestion but this was ignored and the booking made, I did not have the time whilst working to be messed about I gave up and requested a refund.I had time off the following week so I decided to try once more to get the tyres sorted only to be misled by the search engine metadata and my own eagerness for a bargain, I was in too much of a hurry and thought I had finally found a real bargain, I did not check properly and I bought a smaller size 18 inch instead of 19 inch.I noticed as soon as I got the confirmation email and sent an email requesting the size change and to cancel the fitting date. obviously I would have to pay the difference.An email arrived confirming the fitting time so I sent another email requesting contact, 5 hours later I got another email (this is quick but seems like forever when you need something sorting)the email informed me I wanted to change the tyres I had already bought to the same ones really? why on earth would anyone want that? again they are not reading emails, I responded correcting the mistake.The following day I had heard nothing regarding the change and the appointment was due that day, I then received a text informing me my appointment was due in 30 minutes.I sent another email asking for urgent contact.Hours later still nothing.I then spent around ten minutes on hold only to be politely informed that someone would phone me back in a few hours.They did as promised phone me back and finally I got a person who listened, I explained my mistake she quickly sorted it explained the extra cost and booked the day and time for me.The fitter Mckinnon Motors was great again really quick and courteous.It is such a shame a hassle free way of getting a good deal on tyres is marred by poor communication skills.When it works it really works, when something goes wrong it can be a challenge.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Good price, beat all the local tyre suppliers particularly because there was a special weekend discount.

Your technician showed up at 8:10 with no apology or explanation. I gave him my keys, he said it would take around half an hour. 20 minutes later at 8:30 he phoned me to say he couldn‚Äôt find my locking nut, I explained where it was (in the tyre-change kit‚Ä¶not a particularly obtuse place for it to be located?), he still couldn‚Äôt find it. I went back to the car to show him where it was, he stated that he didn‚Äôt have time to rummage through people‚Äôs stuff. I submit that if he‚Äôd shown up on time he‚Äôd have had an extra 10-15 minutes to rummage through my stuff.

Good price and the service worked dont call the company you will be robbed. Good price and the service worked. However the online credit card transaction defaulted after my card was approved which meant I had to call [REDACTED] on their customer service number.

Following the call I received a message from my mobile phone provider telling me that the call cost over ¬£30...ironically the call was a Wi-fi call so ordinarily would not cost anything thing.

"Ordering the tyres online and getting them delivered was absolutely fine and they would get 5 stars for this. However the issues I had with the garage (F1 Autocentres - Gloucester) after is the reason this gets a low star rating.I was originally booked in for a Saturday. I turn up, after getting a reminder of my booking via text I might add. The garage didn't have any fitters to do my tyres. They were sick. So I was a bit annoyed they couldn't have informed me before I left. But I don't blame them for people calling in sick. I was asked to come back on Sunday.So I turn up on Sunday @ 11am and since I didn't need the car I was happy to leave it there all day. Was told to come back at 4pm. I come back and they have not even started my car. I had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn't do the tracking I had requested with it. The only positive, and why I gave 2 stars and not 1. Is they offered to do the tracking for free.Had to go back on Tuesday. I turn up on time as requested, but they are not ready, ask me to come back in 45 minutes. So I do that, have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen. At the end they only did the front tracking. So I had to go back again on Wednesday. This time I was seen within 20 minutes of arriving.But overall the service was not good. Having to go back 4 times just to have 2 tyres fitted and tracking. I will not be using that garage again. Unfortunately for [REDACTED], I am running out of garages to try with them and get a good service. So I might soon be looking to get my tyres elsewhere.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

"Two weeks later and the tyres havent arrived! I showed up for a fitting, despite [REDACTED] knowing the tyres weren't there, they still let me show up. Not a phone call.

Agreed to have them fitted myself, if they deliver to the billing address. Was lied to and told 3-5 days. One of the 4 original tyres is damaged and so its unsafe to continue driving, so i've rented a car for the 3-5 days. Despite knowing this. Communication is lacking. Tyres haven't arrived 2 weeks after ordering. Emails aren't being replied to. Terrible customer service. Havent been refunded yet on the installation costs which weren't provided. Can't get my head around how poor the buying experience has been.

I booked my tyre change for a complete set of tyres for an Aston Martin DB9. The appointed garage was excellent and the service was superb. My complaint is that the tyres I received were date stamped 2017 therefore were at least 2 years old. Upon complaining about this to [REDACTED] directly I was informed that these tyres are not pressed often and therefore up to date tyres could not be guaranteed. Unfortunately due to time commitments I was unable to reschedule my fitting and had to go ahead with the 2017 tyres. The car does not do a big mileage and therefore I have paid for tyres that are already at least two years short on their life cycle due to the natural degradation of the rubber compound.

"I‚Äôve bought dozens of Michelin tyres from Costco (very professional tyre-fitting) but on this occasion I just wanted some mid-range tyres for 20yr old (but 80,000) Volvo V70 T5 that we keep sentimentally along with the other car that my dad owned when he died 5yrs ago. Chose Kumho‚Äôs as I‚Äôd bought a 2nd hand BMW with these on a few years ago and they seemed OK. Existing Avon (ZV-7‚Äôs(?)) only 20% worn / 2 years old, but showing extensive micro-cracking to sidewalls. (Incidentally: Seen this before on Avon‚Äôs put on the kids‚Äô cars, so consequently wouldn‚Äôt touch these again).Responded to customer satisfaction email from [REDACTED] commenting that jobsheet disclosed that fitters has seriously over-torqued wheelnuts (140Nm vs. 110Nn), suggesting they might want to look at their QC/spec. on this. By the time I got a response, requesting a copy of the jobsheet, it had become clear that one of the fitted tyres was not holding pressure, so advised this additionally, when sending copy jobsheet Invited to return to fitting depot to rectify. Unfortunately, return visit was an absolute object lesson in how NOT to deal with a customer service issue, particularly in a business where the customers need to be assured of the professionalism of the service with which they are being provided, not least because it impacts directly on their safety.So:- (Manager) Don‚Äôt moan to me as soon as I arrive that you‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen dealing with nothing but problems all day!‚Äù. I don‚Äôt care. I just want you to do what should have done properly with my car in the first place.- (Fitter) Crack the wheel nuts off with the tyre on the ground, not against the auto gearbox-‚ÄúPark‚Äù. This is car DIY, page 1. Unbelievable!- (Manager) Don‚Äôt tell me that ‚Äúoften old cars leak from the rims‚Äù, inferring there‚Äôs nothing to be done in that case. I drove more than a million miles a bought maybe a hundred tyres before you were even born sonny and know perfectly well that there will often be slight corrosion on the bead seat of even a very new alloy wheel, and this is capable of compromising the integrity of the air seal. Any tyre fitter who knows his salt will inspect the rim, note this, and, as necessary, wire brush or even file this smooth.- (Manager) When faced with my sceptical look about ‚Äúleaky rims‚Äù, don‚Äôt then pathetically backtrack and suggest kerbing, or a pothole as the culprit (what, in the 20 miles since fitting?!) The rim was not inspected and properly prepared for fitting and that‚Äôs all there is to it. - (Fitter) Tighten the wheenuts down in a star pattern, not a circle. And do the same with each of the nuts. Just because there are 5, you don‚Äôt have to forget to torque down the 5th! I watched you! - (Fitter) Having been told the other wheel remains over-torqued to 140Nm where‚Äôs the spec is 110, don‚Äôt check it with your torque wrench set at 110Nm and then tell me it‚Äôs OK - you need to loosen the nuts off first and then do it again properly, to the correct torque! God Almighty!They‚Äôve had their chance, and another, so suffice it to say I will not be darkening their doorstep again. It‚Äôs a shame, because their choice of tyres is good and sometimes you just need something respectable, mid-range, not ultra-premium, in a tyre. It would never happen, because their prices for the latter,e.g. Michelin, are higher than Costco, but theoretically I could have been going to [REDACTED] and spending ¬£1200+ on 4 tyres for one of my other cars, not ¬£150 on 2...

"Shocking service. I ordered four tyres on 25 June to be fitted on 4 July. On the evening of 3 July I had a phone call telling me the tyres hadn't been delivered to the garage.

"I've used [REDACTED] previously several times for tyre purchase and fitting for three of my cars and each time the service has worked seamlessly and very efficiently. On a previous occasion, I needed to contact their CS dept. and was rapidly and properly served by a helpful, professional and friendly UK agent. Lots of companies could potentially sell tyres only online but [REDACTED].com also have the UK national fitting service options fully covered. So each time, as now, I purchased tyres from [REDACTED].com and ordered a fitting service from ATS Euromaster at our branch in Knutsford (incidentally those friendly guys there, Mark & Andy, are always excellent and bang on time). The fact that [REDACTED].com deliver exactly the tyre you order online to your chosen fitting depot and it's always there for when you arrive for the fitting is great. In short, it all works without any fuss or issue. Plus importantly, the [REDACTED] prices have always been the most competitive (online or offline); with or without the fitting element.

"The company that only puts itself first never the customer. Was given unacceptably last minute notice my tyres were not going to be delivered and ready for fitting, -despite the fact I had taken time off work for this appointment in advance (and could not reclaim that day of holiday with such short notice). [REDACTED] have remained totally unappreciative of that lost holiday and great inconvenience. Indeed they have made no acknowledgment of this complaint whatsoever -that is how much they respect customers and value a customer's time. [REDACTED] have a diabolical level of customer care that not only completely ignores any complaint you might make or loss suffered, but also will take atleast 24 hours to offer you any response at all (making rescheduling even more inconvenient). I had to schedule the appointment myself directly with the fitter as [REDACTED] proved utterly redundant as any support or help in this way. It was then my horror to experience their recommended fitter (Johnsons Motors) jack up my car incorrectly (despite my clear and polite request the fitter confirm with me where to jack my car before raising it). I had to shout at the unresponsive engineer to lower my car immediately upon noticing (only by chance) their incompetence. The fitter then proved argumentative, dishonest before shouting their refusal to do any further work at all -despite the fact the work was already paid for via [REDACTED]. I have made yet another complaint to [REDACTED] for this further diabolical low level of quality product and customer service offered via their company -who have again sought to ignore this complaint as well. They have also so far ignored my fair and rightful request of a full refund. Without any service, any real communication and no product honoured, -I am now considering legal action to recover my funds and potential losses from damages.

Used many times before but never again. Ordered my tyres and selected my fitting date. Got an email to delay fitting date by 4 days because they claimed they couldn't get the tyres in that time. Arrived at selected garage on rearranged day and time and tyres hadn't arrived. Rang customer services and was told that the tyres were on the van and would be delivered later that day sometime. Fitting garage said they can get the tyres for the following day so I cancelled the [REDACTED] order and told the garage to order them in. They were paid for the tyres almost a week earlier but told me a refund would take 3-5 days. Told them this wasn't acceptable and the refund must be made that day. Tyres were fitted mid-day the following day and was told that the [REDACTED] tyres were delivered at the same time as the ones they ordered.

"I had my tyres fitted by one of the approved garages, Formula One, in Newport Pagnell. The tyres were fitted, no problem, but when returned to my car the drivers seat was dirty.

"Unfortunately, you can't beat their prices, but I've had some mixed experiences, and I'm struggling to trust the honesty / integrity of the company as a whole.1) I booked a fitted service for my wife's car, and was given a timed appointment, which was really inconvenient (no choice of times), so I called customer service to see if it could be changed ""let me check with the garage"" said the lady on the phone, followed by ""the garage has no other availability on that day"", etc, etc. So I called the garage directly and explained that I'd like to come earlier if possible and got ""no problem sir, come along for when we open, and we'll get you straight in""... did customer service actually speak with the garage, given how accommodating they were when I called, I doubt it!2) Different garage, and 4 tyres for my car... I had a very poor experience where it apparently took the garage 2 hours 10 minutes to change 4 tyres, and a very muddled experience from start to finish... they didn't have my paperwork, couldn't find my tyres, were questioning whether I was there on the right day, etc. and then the length of time to actually change the tyres, whilst mechanics floated aimlessly around the garage doing nothing. I took the time to write a detailed review of the garage on the [REDACTED] website, but that review hasn't been published weeks on, and the garage still has a 5 star rating, leading me to believe that [REDACTED] are trying to protect the reputation of their premier partner garages despite customer experiences.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"Arrived at garage to be informed that you had sent one correct tyre long with no incorrectly sized tyre, the problem was further exaggerated by [REDACTED] making a other appointment without consultation with me for 4 days later when I was due to be away.

The one positive was that the tyres eventually procured were in fact cheaper than through [REDACTED], so if anyone is reading this please ring around your local dealers before committing yourself.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"Initial purchasing experience was fine. There was an issue with the fitting date (the mobile fitter couldn't make the date I selected) but I communicated with Rajesh and then Bihan to get a different date agreed. That was all fine however once the fitter had completed everything and was about to leave, he told me that he couldn't balance the tyres as he didn't have the necessary fitment for my wheels. I contacted [REDACTED] customer service by email to try and resolve this but didn't get a reply, meaning I had to take my car to a separate service centre and pay an additional ¬£38 to get the four wheels balance. My overall impression is that [REDACTED] are good to communicate with (prompt and polite) prior to the sale, but follow up service, at least in my case, was non existent.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Can't fault [REDACTED] really. I did a call around for prices and took advantage of the [REDACTED] flash sale. It saved money even without the sale discount. I even told the garages I was calling around checking prices. The fitting garage was excellent but I felt a little guilty they did all the work for just the fitting price but they made a bit more as I knew my tracking was out.

"I have used [REDACTED] for years, buying puncture replacements, replacing worn out tyres and getting Snow Tyres for mountain driving. If you need help, the staff are great.

Used [REDACTED] a fair few times with no issues. The most recent time they cancelled the tyre fitting via email stating garage couldn‚Äôt support the fitment.

I had a booking at 10.30am. I turned the fitters said it would take 1.5Hrs to fit the tyres on my car as it was a Tesla. I have had tyres fitted before only took around 30min. they were extremely busy. based on this I got a taxi to my brother's because what was I going to do for an hour and a half. I got a call at 11.47 from the tyre fitters asking me for my pin so that could start the electric engine in my car to move it. It had not been moved from where I parked it At 12.30 I decided to go back down to the tyre fitters they were still in the process of fitting my tyres. My car was blocked by another car that had no wheels on it. I the had to wait for these wheels to be fitted. I finally got away about 1.30pm. I had asked for the best of the 2 tyres to be put into my boot. so that I could keep it for emergency puncture replacement. I got home it was not there. I had to go back again and waste another 10-20 minutes while they looked for my tyre.

"Poor customer service. Well having used [REDACTED] before I opted to purchase some fully fitted tyres from them.Got the confirmation email and booking for fitting, so I took half day off work to allow, very late email arrives saying delay and so booking moved a day forward. So another half day booked and what another late email saying can‚Äôt actually get hold of tyres? I rang their customer services who had no sympathy at all for 2 half days being booked and they could offer me cheaper tyres at the same price of which I refused. I explained that my chosen tyres were still on sale on their website but for some reason were almost ¬£20 more for each tyre, could this be the reason? Who knows, anyway I had to opt for different tyres to be fitted which meant another delay and more time off work.

This is not the first time we have had unnerving experiences at tyre fitting centres, but we both felt that online tyre retailers need to have more strict vetting of their recommended fitting partners, to raise the bar to the standards they would wish to experience themselves.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"This was my first time trying [REDACTED].com. I was desperate to get some tyres for the next day after picking up a puncture on the Thursday and having a weekend trip leaving on the Friday night and it's amazing how hard it is to get decent sport tyres for the next day as no-one carries stock. I'd first tried making a booking with Kwik Fit mobile fittings, they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back. The only other place I could find was [REDACTED].com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage. It seemed too good to be true, HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next Tuesday yet [REDACTED] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price. The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing. The appointment was first thing the next morning, tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done. It does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like National to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days, plus the price is very good, so I will certainly look to [REDACTED].com again in the future.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"Ordered my tyres online and picked the place, day, and time well in advance, as this was the only day I could manage, and got the conformation email. 3 days later they emailed saying they could not do that day or time, and I would have to pick another day, which was no use to me as I would be working. They then said I could change the garage and get the same day, but I had to pick up the tyres from the first garage and take them with me to the other garage.So again got the confirmation email with the day and time and new garage a little further away, but when I arrived home that evening....they had sent another email saying they had changed the time from 9.30 to 1.30 in the after noon without asking me.

"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy's fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

2 really friendly/ professional lads fitted Avon ZZ5‚Äôs to front wheels of car. They were really careful not to damage the (as yet unscathed) alloy wheels.

Was quoted an unbelievable price to remove lock nuts at ¬£40 a tyre. I refused and contacted [REDACTED] after wards. I looked for an alternative booking as I was able to remove the lock nuts.

Finally have received confirmation that my refund will be in my account in 3 to 5 days basically delaying the whole process by 7 day of no responses and 5 days refund which is nearly two weeks.

The website was so easy to use and I managed to find a local garage to fit a new tyre for a very competitive price. I was very relieved as other tyre companies couldn‚Äôt even find a tyre to fit as the car was a 2019 number plate . When they did I had to wait a week for a tyre to be delivered! Not good when you have only 3 useable tyres . The garage I went to next day were friendly and really good. The receptionist was so welcoming and even made me a cup of tea while I waited.

"Original fitting day was cancelled. Subsequently contacted [REDACTED] and arranged new fitting day. Queried with [REDACTED] why there was no time on the confirmation email and was told it was a first come first served basis. On arriving at the fitting centre they had no record of this new booking and said that they didn't have a tyre fitter in that day so couldn't fit my tyres. Rebooked directly with them for Monday 12th at 9am. Turned up promptly and it still took an hour and 15mins for my tyres to be done. Email thread below. Your request has been updated. To add additional comments, reply to this email. Vishnu, Aug 1, 09:53 BST: Dear Martin, Thank you for your email. The garage works on first come first serve basis so you can visit the garage anytime between 09:00 - 11:30 for AM appointment. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

"Cornish holiday not spoiled by my damaged tyre. Had a problem with a tyre splitting along the tread so even though I was on holiday I felt it needed to be changed. Used [REDACTED] because the fitting company was closest to my holiday address. Prices were very good and they offered a discount for 2 tyres so went for that. I checked that the fitter had received the tyres before I drove over. Communications were excellent. Ordering was really easy, and the tyres were delivered in good time. Garage provided a tyre fitting report showing all the job details. They also provided me with a brake inspection report.

[REDACTED] themselves are really good and reliable but I would suggest they need to review some of the garages that they use for the fitting.

"I had 4 new Yokohama Tyres which I had installed on 21st December. I brought the vehicle back to the fitting centre a couple of days later.

Cant fault [REDACTED] but pick you fitter carefully as Jeffreys tyres in Warrington who I picked were poor. I booked an Am appointment via the [REDACTED] sit and duly turned up around 9 am to be told they couldn't even look at it until 12 and was asked to leave my car with them. I said i booked Am and was told they dont do appointments. Do i sail i will return at 12 and was again told they dont do appointments.

"I would have given five stars, but the tyres hadn't been delivered to the fitting station for the allotted time slot (they arrived three days later). The helpdesk was very helpful & polite though.However, in regard of value for money (nevermind the ease of choosing and booking on line and not having to buy from the limited range of my local tyre 'specialists') the other four stars are well deserved.

Completing my order online was simple and easy.

"Poor information if tyres not delivered. I ordered tyres and set the fitting date for 1 wheel later. I received a confirmation email later that day.On arrival at the garage I was informed that the garage had been shut for the last 2 weeks due to their summer holiday. The tyres had therefore not been delivered. I received no email or call for [REDACTED] to say that the tyres had not been delivered, so I wasted time (taken as time off from work) going to the garage.I rearranged the fitting and only got confirmation at 10:10pm the night before which is too late to rearrange my work for the following day.May I suggest that in future if the tyre supplier cannot make the delivery that you inform the customer?

Price was great and very convinient having a time slot but the service was poor. There was debate over whether it could be done because there was a small amount of snow on the ground and they were having a problem getting cars on the ramp.

"Not very interested. I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles, my second visit through [REDACTED] and they are absolutely fantastic! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The reason for the poor rating is this, before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik. I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [REDACTED] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection. I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day. Looking at the [REDACTED] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location, so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later, only to be told to collect the car in four hours time. Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best. I spoke to [REDACTED] about this and, while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price, they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged. I felt like a second class customer for using [REDACTED] in Penicuik, if the conditions were made plain on the website, I would have been able to make a different choice. Worse was the fact that [REDACTED] customer relations were not interested in addressing what I think is a real issue.Incidentally I did not bother with the discount as I was delighted with the service I received in Peebles.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

"If you want cheap tyres and terrible service this is for you. What an utter disappointment. Ordered Tyres to the local fitter on the 2nd of August for fitting on the the 7th. Money taken on the 2nd. On the 6th I get an email at 15:45 that there is an issue with delivery and I need to rearrange the fitting time and day. As I don't constantly look at my emails I only saw this mail after 6pm when I could not phone them. Phone them the next day, waited 10 minutes before I was answered and apologised to me saying that I can get them fitted on Friday at the same time as my Wednesday appointment had been. Friday comes and I get to the fitter who tells me that they have only had 3 tyres delivered of the 4 I ordered and paid for. I ended up having the three fitted and left the best one of the previous 4 on. I phoned them whilst I was at the fitter. They apologised again and said that they will refund the 4th tyre, Give me ¬£20 off and also a 10% voucher for when next I use them. Of course that was just to fob me off and I only received the refund for the tyre. Not a happy customer and will rather pay more per tyre at another provider than get messed around by this rather unimpressive outfit.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"DisappointingMy review reflects the individual garage that put the tyres on my car. I phoned in advance to give my arrival time and was told it was quiet.

"I found the staff at BC.com very polite and helpful and BC themselves were/are one of the cheapest online tyre suppliers. My gripe though concerns the fact that having ordered and paid online for 5 tyres for my Land-rover, when the day came for them to be fitted I had rung up the previous afternoon to be told they didn‚Äôt have the tyres so the fitting wouldn‚Äôt take place. As it was a home fitting I‚Äôd taken the day off!!!!I was then told they could get four of the tyres for me by the following Tuesday and the fifth by the Friday. Great thought I.Well, I got my four tyres fitted on the Tuesday. No problem.Thursday afternoon came at at about 5.30pm I got an email from BC stating they couldn‚Äôt get my 5th tyre and ‚Äúhow did I want to proceed‚Äù.Livid???? Just a tad.I called BC but by then they‚Äôd closed for the day, so rang first thing the next day. Very helpful and polite lady understood my frustrations but went on to tell me that the tyre I‚Äôd ordered, paid for and expected to be fitted that morning couldn‚Äôt be obtained and BC didn‚Äôt know when they‚Äôd get some in. Great!!!Bottom line is a tyre was sourced (in Spain), and was eventually fitted the following Wednesday. Three weeks this took to complete.My advice would be make sure BC either have or can immediately source the tyres you‚Äô after before committing to the deal.","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"I have used [REDACTED] several times, in three different Fitting Garages with excellent results. Easy to order, easy to pay and great communications from the company. Unfortunately, my latest experience was married slightly by the Tyre Fitting Garage having an attitude that made me feel like I was in the way. The fitter spent 10 minutes on his mobile phone in the middle of the job and when I asked the Receptionist if they would swap the tyres ""front to back and back to front"" I was told there would be a charge of ¬£6.99 per wheel, despite the car already being raised to fit two new tyres.

identifying the correct tyres was easier on your site than other sites all this worked well.

"The actual purchasing and delivery of my four new Cross climate tyres from [REDACTED] went smoothly enough. My problems started when the partner garage (Auto Pfect at Wath on Dearne) could not accommodate me on the date I booked on line and I therefore had to rearrange it and wait a further week as it needed to be a weekend. The tyres seemed to be fitted fine but I had to ask them to find my locking wheel nut key as it was not in the car. A few days later I took my car to the Kia dealership for mot and service. The car failed because the tyre on the rear drivers side had been fitted the wrong way round!! Apparently the tyres are directional. Kia sorted out the tyre for a cost and passed the car and the garage who fitted the tyres reimbursed me for that cost. I chose Auto Pfect because [REDACTED] rated them as a premium fitter, and despite the staff being friendly and generally helpful, the mistakes made were very basic and avoidable for a professional tyre fitting garage. I certainly wouldn't trust them to provide other services and will stick to the trusted main Kia dealer.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Firstly, my tyre was not available on the day I booked. The day before my appointment, I was contacted as the delivery could not be made by the allotted time. This seems like rather poor planning on [REDACTED]' part. I had to change my weekend plans and miss an important event because I couldn't drive the long distance on my tyre that needed to be replaced. Secondly, the available locations were confusing, as there were multiple locations for the same business (Charles Hurst). Having chosen one, when I went to the business on the day, no one seemed to be aware of my booking - either in the chosen location, or in the second location I was sent to. Only the tyre that I had ordered (which turned up at the second location without any mention of a booking) led to the staff at the second location being aware of the booking, and so they were able to carry out the tyre change. The booking system appeared robust and I was pleased with the price, the people at the garage were courteous and the service provided at the garage was good, but the above two points really annoyed me.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

The first & last time I will ever use you. I am still waiting for my tyres to be done. You took ¬£190+ from my account straight away. You then cancelled the first job. I complained & was assured it was booked in for a few days later. I was also told I would be refunded for the cost of them coming directly to my house. Wiltshire Tyres then called me that morning to say they had to chase YOU up as YOU had not re-booked my tyres with them. Wiltshire Tyres then called me again today as they were due to come to my house tomorrow 9am-1pm. They informed me that their driver is sick and now I have to drive my car to Andover (40 miles away) to get the tyres fitted.

"Trouble free from choosing to fitting. This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED].The process of comparing, choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. They have several top Brands and a large overall choice.And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me.You chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive. Supply them the order number and abit of information like which tyres you want replacing etc and then sit back and they'll deal with everything. You can leave a review of the garage afterwards to help others decide.You can even copy the appointment info straight into the calendar which is a nice touch. The app links to mapping services to direct you to the garage.If the garage offers other services you can order these aswell, but if there's a charge then you will have to pay that direct to the garage while there.The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms.The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know who can benefit from the service.Prices are competitive and I found them to be cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.If you don't require fitting then for a reduced price they will deliver the tyres straight to an alternative address.If you need to cancel your order for any reason then they don't question it or try to convince you not to. They simply issue a full refund. No pressure at all. Easy.My experience with [REDACTED] was excellent. I will be using the service next time I require tyre services.Takes the worry out of searching, buying and arranging fittings!","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

Good service in the past but now no facility to phone to get advice. The fitter I selected did not give appointments and worked on a first come first served basis.

"[REDACTED], i cannot fault. My only issue is with the fitting garage. Why they cannot put the correct tyre pressures when fitting my new tyres, they put them 4psi too low.

Let down so badly - I wish I did not have to give this review even 1 star as they are not worth it.They Emailed me at 17.17 last night saying they could not fit my tires the following day as already arranged. (They close at 17.30). I was traveling 5000 miles round trip the following day and my tires would become illegal during that time so urgently needed them done.They never responded to my email and I was on hold in a phone que for 35 minutes. Got put through to escaltion team who took another 10 minutes to answer.The only thing that was reasonable was the manner in which the complaint team approached the complaint however the best they could do is offer a refund plus ¬£30 and a 10% discount on future purchases. The extra ¬£30 did not even cover the additional costs that I incurred but at least they were polite and sypathetic and agreed to feed back that a phone call so late in the day would have been appropriate to give me some options..

Looked online and found [REDACTED] has very competitive pricing so booked the fitting. It was nice to be able to choose the garage to get the job done and I picked the [REDACTED] Pitstop next to Tesco.

Notified the day before fitting that delay to delivery of tyre and next available fitting was a Saturday 3 days after original booking. Had no option but to rearrange my weekend as a result. Then I received an email 2hrs after my original appointment advising the tyre had been delivered which was a slap in the face. Also when I the wait time while attempting to contact [REDACTED] via telephone was ridiculously long. The call handler also continually laughed and giggled when I told her my name. Pretty sure if I had laughed at her foreign name it would be classed as racism. Not impressed. No issues with the fitting centre itself.

Mainly because when my wife turned up at the garage with my 3 year old son the garage had only been sent 3 of the correct tyres. So my wife had to wait for an hour before the 4th tyre arrived. The garage told us they had contacted you the day before when the wrong tyre had arrived so you could let me know but I never had any contact from [REDACTED] regarding this. It was only by chance the tyre turned up as my wife was about to leave. Not very impressed with her having to wait around when everything was booked especially having our young son with her.

Why do it any other way. You get to chose the tires and pick what garage you want at a time that suits you.

"I've only given this 5 stars because of the fantastic service Phil provided.I had new tyres fitted a couple of Saturday's ago, four days before my MOT and service.Noticed on the Sunday that the TPMS fault light was on which would be an MOT failure.Went back when they opened on Monday and was told the light was off when the tyres had been fitted. I couldn't take a pressure reading so something was affecting the valve. The valve was fiddled with and I was told to come back the next day when Phil was there.Contacted [REDACTED] CS and was told I'd get a quick callback.However all I got was an email on the Tuesday with all the reasons why a TPMS might fail and to go to the garage.On returning on Tuesday Phil was there, straight away removed the tyre, and it was clear the TPMS must have been damaged during the fitting and then shearing whilst driving at motorway speeds. He couldn't be more apologetic and arranged for their mobile fitter to come out and fit a new sensor.All in all fantastic service and saved the day.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Purchased on the behalf of a vehicle workshop. Order placed on Monday at 11.55am for 2 tyres at over ¬£400, promised delivery of Tuesday next day. I received an apologetic email and a voicemail outside of office hours at 5.35pm Monday, that stated the tyres would not arrive Tuesday but Wednesday instead. Contacted [REDACTED] on the phoneline on Thursday PM after realising that we had not yet had a delivery. The call handler explained that there had been a courier issue and that the tyres could not be supplied until the following Monday, 7 days after initial order. They were apologetic that I had not been contacted but couldn't offer an explanation as to why I was not informed that delivery would be delayed. Although the call handler was apologetic, it was explained that these tyres were for a client vehicle and had caused a delay in it being returned to the customer. I was offered 10% discount on next order, which I did not accept. As a gesture of goodwill it is lovely but doesn't help with the current issue & let down client. I have now sourced the tyres elsewhere, which have been delivered on Friday (today). It has taken 13mins on hold at peak time to cancel the order, (please change the on hold music :) !) but credit to both call handlers who chased the order, courier, and cancelled the order. Both very professional and did their best to assist.

"Had an awful experience. The tyres are great goodyears so can't really go wron [REDACTED] need to take more car when selecting garages to fit there tyres. The issues I have is with the garage who fitted the tyres david duthie motors peebles they have chipped, scratched and made gouges round the rims. When I contacted the garage ( David duthie motors ) peebles they said the alloys are corroded they do have small areas of corrosion and not the cause of the damage there are even Mark's on the centre of the wheel where it has been secured to the machine.I have myself been in the automotive trade for over 20 years and in my early days fitting tyres if I had damaged a customers alloys like they have mine I would have offered to repair them without question. I think its ridiculous a so called [REDACTED] authorised installer can treat a customer like this. Safe to say I will never set foot in this garage again i won't be recommending david duthie motors peebles to anyone in fact I'll be telling my family and friends to go elsewhere, due to this experience probably never use [REDACTED] again.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Tyres and [REDACTED] service and price was good . I didn't have confidence with the fitters. I asked them to torque the wheel bolts to 170NM. They said this was too tight but I insisted.

"Initial appointment delayed due to courier losing one of my tyres, rescheduled appointment was not suitable for me as I required my car for that time to travel over 100 miles, which I explained in my email, I was emailed back saying it was the earliest appointment I could get. This resulted in me then phoning during my working hours, to be told I could get my appointment changed to the following day after my initial one, which was more suitable. I was also told the missing tyre would be tracked to make sure it was delivered the following day. Lunchtime the following day my appointment was changed again but to the day after I required my car for! This again resulted in me having to make another phone call and to be told my second tyre was not yet delivered but should be at the site that afternoon. I managed to get the third appointment which was confirmed the day before back, explaining that I needed at least one of the tyres changed. I dropped off my car the following morning at around 7.45 am to be told the second tyre had not yet arrived. My appointment was not until 2.00 pm, but one of the reasons I dropped it off earlier was to ensure the message about needing at least one of them to be done had been relayed appropriately from your company. I was told this was done however was struggling to believe that after being told 2 days before that my tyre would be tracked to ensure it was delivered in the following day. The overall experience was quite stressful. I have used this site before in 2018 and had no issues on that occasion.

"As usual I went for the better quality of tyres. This company offered the best price. Less than 23 hours after having the tyres fitted , one of them let me down.

Ordered on-line and gave details of my standard vehicle. Arrived for mid-morning appointment to be told that none of the equipment was capable of lifting it. The staff were critical of their boss who had supplied them with innapropriate lifting equipment which they don't use. Having already paid for the tyres + fitting I had no choice but to load up the 4 tyres and drive 3 junctions down the Motorway to another affiliated garage and have them fitted that afternoon.. Wasted my day.There's no point being able to order on-line if the the computer does'nt recognise and decline unsuitable vehicles at the point of purchase.

"Do not use Very poor customer service. Yes, the tyres they sell are at a more competitive price than the manufacturer of my car however their customer service is appalling.

There was no explanation for the delay and they rebooked me a new slot without even phoning me to discuss a suitable day. As a result I had to take a day off work to accommodate this as I couldn‚Äôt postpone the fitting any longer.

"Kind of feel strange leaving this review since I purchased from them based on the Truspilot's generally great feedback for this company...The appointment cancelled by a text. Alright, I thought.. this happens... The cancellation text followed by a polite email from one of their representatives... - 'We are working on it' etc.... Good, they are taking care of it... Unfortunately, no follow up the next day. An email sent to them.. and another one. Still no reply... - Right, looks like I will need to ring them, I thought. After 10 min of waiting finally managed to get through, but the line was so bad I was transferred to another call... 10 min... 15 min... no answer. I had to hang up and go back to work...I am selling my car and promised the guy I will put a new set of tyres on her... I know [REDACTED] doesn't care, but if they tell me they can get those fitted in two days and get good online reviews - well that's why I am buying from them and not elsewhere. I am kind of seriously stuck here because of them!***UPDATE***An email eventually came saying the tyres have been delivered and asking me if I had been aware of it and already had them fitted(???).... I replied saying noone let me know anything and I'm still awaiting for the appointment to be rescheduled. Guess what? No reply again. The next morning I decided I'm not going to deal with them via email any more, and just headed (without an appointment) to the garage in question and asked if they had received my tyres (they had). Explained what'd been going on and fortunately they kindly agreed to fit them for me. I'm not sure if this was just an isolated example of poor case handling by [REDACTED] or this is the way they treat their customers in general, should something go wrong.I normally don't have time for this sort of rubbish (unanswered emails, waiting in a phone queue for ages). You normally get a pretty decent customer service nowadays and its KEY to build good reputation for online retailers. Not good.*********************Hi TomI am really sorry for this issue.No, you are not. You don't care and only leave this comment here to make it look as if you care.

The following day I check in with BC to be told that they can't actually fit my tyres for when I have booked (and paid) for.

Price was good and choice of fitting locations is helpful. Generally satisfied with [REDACTED].Just 2 issues:- Once a fitting service is selected you are given a calendar to select the day and time. Having selected an early morning time for my convenience at the designated supplier i was contacted later and told the time selected wasnt available. That was less convenient.The supplier selected was the nearest & most convenient but they were a mainstream BMW garage and not a specialist tyre fitter. They were clearly more focused on their BMW customers and despite clear instructions fitted the replacement tyre on the wrong wheel. This was apologetically rectified but resulted in the fitting of one tyre taking 2 hours. Instead of being fitted and on my way by 9-00 am as originally planned it was gone 12-00 when the job was completed.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

Good tyres shame about the fitting. Good prices and a very wide range of tyres.

"Fitting superb but need more realistic appointment dates. Booking experience was a little disappointing. Was offered appointments on the website from Thursday, so chose the following Friday morning. [REDACTED] came back to say the garage couldn't carry out the work then, and offered Saturday morning instead, which wasn't convenient. To save time, I rang and spoke to a very helpful lady who organised it for first thing on the following Wednesday.The fitting experience was superb. I arrived, handed over the keys, and just under an hour later, the job was completed and the keys were returned.I spoke with the receptionist about the fitting dates. She told me that the delay was due to [REDACTED] not being able to supply the tyres in time for the first date I chose.Perhaps [REDACTED] should offer more realistic appointment dates to allow enough time for the tyres to arrive at the fitting location.","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"The bloke who fitted the tyres was great - turned up on time - knew his stuff - no problem at all there.They quote an all-inclusive price for fitted tyres so I was a bit niggled to find that when their website advertises X% off it means X% off the tyres and 0% off the fitting (even though they don't actually split the price between tyres and fitting) so it cost me a couple of pounds more per tyre than it led me to believe. Yes, I know what it says in the (very) small print but when it says ""discount"" in size 60 font and ""subject to terms and conditions"" in size 6 font and you can only find the terms and conditions in the bottom of locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a notice on the door saying ""beware of the leopard"" it doesn't quite give the impression that you'd expect of a straightforward business.

"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

Great if you want to wait 3 weeks. Have been trying to book in my tyre repair for weeks. Incredibly slow to respond. Originally I booked the tyre fitting on a Tuesday for the Saturday morning. They waited until just before 6pm on the Friday to let me know they actually can't do it on the Saturday. Have been going back and forth for two weeks. Asked if they can do the following Saturday to which they said we only have time on Monday. Ended up just calling the garage like you either have the tyre or not?

"Ordered two Continentals for our VW Tiguan. Ordered on a Wednesday and was given a Friday appointment. Turned up on Friday and the tyres hadn't been delivered. [REDACTED] rearranged for the following Wednesday, but on the Tuesday they cancelled it and rearranged for Thursday then again to the Friday! Went through a few customer service employees who all said the tyres had been delivered and that the garage was at fault. We finally got someone who actually worked to get the problem sorted (Taylor). She got the tyres ordered on a next day delivery for us to finally get them fitted. She kept decent contact through out the time she dealt with it. Decent cost saving but was a hassle.
